# Applied CFD Tutorials
Welcome to the Applied Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Tutorials repository. This repository contains a series of hands-on tutorials designed to help undergraduate students learn and apply CFD principles using **OpenFOAM**, a leading open-source CFD software, and **ParaView**, a powerful visualization tool.

## Repository Contents
1. [Tutorial 0: Setting up WSL and OpenFOAM](Tutorial_0/README.md)
   
   Learn how to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (`wsl`) and **OpenFOAM** on your Windows machine. This tutorial includes step-by-step instructions to ensure a smooth installation process, especially for beginners.

2. Tutorial 1: Basic Case Setup - Lid-Driven Cavity (LDC) 
   - [Tutorial 1.1 – Introduction to CFD Concepts and OpenFOAM](Tutorial_1/README.md)
   - [Tutorial 1.2 - Setting Up the LDC Problem](Tutorial_1/Tutorial_1_2/README.md)
   - [Tutorial 1.3 - Running the LDC Simulation](Tutorial_1/Tutorial_1_3/README.md)
   
   Dive into setting up your first CFD simulation case. This tutorial covers the initial steps of preparing the lid-driven cavity benchmark case and running it in **OpenFOAM**, and visualizing the results using **ParaView**.

3. Tutorial 2: Laminar Flow Over a Flat Plate
   - [Tutorial 2.1 – Introduction to boundary layer and Blasius Solution](Tutorial_2/README.md)
   - [Tutorial 2.2 – OpenFOAM Setup](Tutorial_2/Tutorial_2_2/README.md)
   - [Tutorial 2.3 – Running the Simulation and Post-Processing](Tutorial_2/Tutorial_2_3/README.md)

   Explore the process of setting up and simulating laminar flow over a flat plate. This tutorial includes the theoretical background of boundary layer development, configuring the simulation in **OpenFOAM**, and analyzing the results using **ParaView**.

## Getting Started
To get started, begin with [Tutorial 0: Setting up WSL and OpenFOAM](Tutorial_0/README.md). Follow the instructions carefully to prepare your system for running **OpenFOAM** simulations. Once set up, proceed to the subsequent tutorials to deepen your understanding and skills in CFD.
