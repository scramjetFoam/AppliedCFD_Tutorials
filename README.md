# Applied CFD Tutorials
Welcome to the Applied Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Tutorials repository. This repository contains a series of hands-on tutorials designed to help undergraduate students learn and apply CFD principles using **OpenFOAM**, a leading open-source CFD software, and **ParaView**, a powerful visualization tool.

## Repository Contents
1. [Tutorial 0: Setting up WSL and OpenFOAM](https://github.com/shimonpi/AppliedCFD_Tutorials/blob/Tutorial_0/README.md)
   
   Learn how to install the **Windows Subsystem for Linux** (`wsl`) and **OpenFOAM** on your **Windows** machine. This tutorial includes step-by-step instructions to ensure a smooth installation process, especially for beginners.
2. Tutorial 1: Basic Case Setup

   Dive into setting up your first CFD simulation case. This tutorial covers the initial steps of preparing the lid-driven cavity benchmark case, running it, and visualizing the results using **ParaView**.

## Getting Started
To get started, begin with [Tutorial 0: Setting up WSL and OpenFOAM](https://github.com/shimonpi/AppliedCFD_Tutorials/blob/Tutorial_0/README.md). Follow the instructions carefully to prepare your system for running **OpenFOAM** simulations. Once set up, proceed to the subsequent tutorials to deepen your understanding and skills in CFD.
