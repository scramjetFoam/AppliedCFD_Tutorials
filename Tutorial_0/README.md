## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to install the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" (`wsl`) and **OpenFOAM** version 11 on your Windows system. 

By following these steps, you will prepare your computer to use **OpenFOAM** for our upcoming simulations. Each step includes detailed instructions to make the installation process as smooth as possible, especially if you are new to working with Linux and terminal commands. 

We will be using the `.org` version of **OpenFOAM**, maintained by the [OpenFOAM Foundation](https://openfoam.org/). The `.org` version focuses on community-driven development and maintaining a consistent open-source philosophy. In contrast, the `.com` version, maintained by [OpenCFD Ltd](https://www.openfoam.com/), is more commercially oriented and includes proprietary features. Both versions share a common root, but for our educational purposes, the `.org` version is more suitable due to its open access and extensive community support.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This guide is intended for Windows users. If you are using macOS, please refer to the [OpenFOAM installation guide for macOS](https://openfoam.org/download/11-macos/).

## Setup

### Step 1: Installing WSL
Before you can run **OpenFOAM**, youâ€™ll need to install `wsl` which allows Windows users to run a Linux environment directly on Windows, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine.

1. Open `PowerShell` as "Administrator":
   - Right-click on the "Start" button and select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)".
2. List available Linux distributions:
   - To see what distributions are available for download, type:
     ```bash
     wsl --list --online
     ```
   - This command will display a list of all the Linux distributions that you can install. Popular choices for **OpenFOAM** include Ubuntu, Debian, or openSUSE.
3. Install the default Linux distribution:
   - Run:
     ```bash
     wsl.exe --install
     ```
   - Restart your computer to complete the installation.
5. Set up your Linux distribution:
   - After restarting, the Linux distribution terminal window should pop up automatically. If not, launch the new Linux terminal via the "Start" menu or by typing its name in `PowerShell` or `Command Prompt` (in our case "Ubuntu").
   - Follow the prompts to set up your new user account and password.

> [!NOTE] 
> When setting up your user account, the password will not appear on the Terminal window as you type it. This is a security feature. Just enter your password and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

> [!NOTE] 
> There are two completely different terminals: one for Windows commands (`PowerShell`), and one for Linux commands (your Linux distribution terminal). Ensure you use the correct terminal for each step.

6. Confirm the installation:
   - Verify that **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** was installed by typing in the Linux terminal:
     ```bash
     lsb_release -a
     ```

### Step 2: Installing OpenFOAM
With your Linux set up, you are now ready to install **OpenFOAM**.

1. Update your Linux system's packages:
   - Update your Linux system's packages:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     ```
     ```bash
     sudo apt full-upgrade -y
     ```
2. Install dependencies required by **OpenFOAM**:
   - Run:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install build-essential
     ```
3. Download and install **OpenFOAM**:
   - Use the following commands:
     ```bash
     sudo sh -c "wget -O - https://dl.openfoam.org/gpg.key > /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/openfoam.asc"
     ```
     ```bash
     sudo add-apt-repository http://dl.openfoam.org/ubuntu
     ```
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     ```
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get -y install openfoam11
     ```
4. Configure the **OpenFOAM** environment:
   - Add to your `.bashrc`:
     ```bash
     echo ". /opt/openfoam11/etc/bashrc" >> $HOME/.bashrc
     ```
   - Refresh the environment variables (note the dot):
     ```bash
     . $HOME/.bashrc
     ```
5. Confirm the installation:
   - Verify that **OpenFOAM** was installed correctly by running:
     ```bash
     foamRun -help
     ```
   - A "Usage" message should appear.
6. Your installation and user configuration are complete.

### Step 3: Installing ParaView
To visualize simulation results, you need to install **ParaView**. Since it's more stable on Windows, we recommend installing it directly.

1. Download the latest version of **ParaView** (`.msi`) from [**ParaView**'s official website](https://www.paraview.org/).
2. Install **ParaView** by following the on-screen instructions.
3. Once installed, you can open **ParaView** from the "Start" menu.

### Step 4: Running a Test Case
To ensure that your installation is functioning correctly, run a simple test case. The test case is taken from the tutorials directory which contains numerous example cases in **OpenFOAM**.

1. Explore the example cases:
   - The tutorials directory location is represented by the `$FOAM_TUTORIALS` variable in the **OpenFOAM** environment.
   - List the top-level contents of the `$FOAM_TUTORIALS` directory by typing in a terminal:
     ```bash
     ls $FOAM_TUTORIALS
     ```
2. Prepare your run directory:
   - The **OpenFOAM** environment includes a `$FOAM_RUN` variable which represents a directory in the user's file system at `$HOME/OpenFOAM/<USER>-11/run` where `<USER>` is the account login name and `11` is the **OpenFOAM** version number. This directory is the recommended location to store and run simulation cases.
     - Create the `run` directory by typing:
       ```bash
       mkdir -p $FOAM_RUN
       ```
     - Check if the directory exists by typing:
       ```bash
       ls $FOAM_RUN
       ```
3. Copy an example case:
   - Any example case from `$FOAM_TUTORIALS` can then be copied into the run directory.
     - To try the lid-driven cavity example for the incompressible fluid solver module, copy it to the run directory by typing:
        ```bash
        cd $FOAM_RUN
        ```

        ```bash
        cp -r $FOAM_TUTORIALS/incompressibleFluid/cavity .
        ```
4. Run the example case:
   - Navigate to the cavity directory:
     ```bash
     cd cavity
     ```
   - Run the simulation by typing:
     ```bash
     blockMesh
     ```

     ```bash
     foamRun
     ```

     ```bash
     touch cavity.foam
     ```
5. Post-process the results using **ParaView**:
   - To use **ParaView** on Windows with files from your `wsl` environment, you need to copy the necessary files to a location in your Windows filesystem. This step ensures **ParaView** can access these files.
     - Open the current directory in `Windows File Explorer` from the Linux terminal:
       ```bash
       explorer.exe .
       ```
     - Copy the cavity case directory from the `wsl` directory to a location in your Windows filesystem. For example, you can copy it to your "Documents" folder on Windows. This will make it accessible to **ParaView** running on Windows.
   - Launch **ParaView** on your Windows machine.
   - Use the "File &rarr; Open" menu to navigate to the copied case files on your Windows filesystem and open the file with the extension `.foam`.
   - After opening the `.foam` file in **ParaView**, click the "Apply" button in the "Properties" panel on the left.
6. Here is what you should see if everything was done correctly:
